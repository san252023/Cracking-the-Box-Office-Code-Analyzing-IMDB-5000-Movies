# Cracking the Box Office Code: Analyzing IMDB 5000 Movies

## Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the IMDB 5000 Movie dataset, with a focus on identifying key patterns that contribute to a movie's success or failure at the box office. By examining various factors such as runtime, genre combinations, and other movie attributes, this analysis seeks to uncover insights into what drives higher revenue and critical acclaim.

## Key Insights

### 1. Runtime Analysis
- **Movies with longer runtimes (over 110 minutes) tend to generate higher revenue and receive better critical reception.**
- Runtimes are categorized into five levels: 
  - **Very Short** (14-65 minutes)
  - **Short** (66-100 minutes)
  - **Medium** (101-110 minutes)
  - **Long** (111-200 minutes)
  - **Very Long** (201-338 minutes)
- Movies in the "Long" and "Very Long" categories generally outperform shorter films.

### 2. Genre Combination Analysis
- **The number of genres a movie belongs to can impact its revenue and average ratings.**
- Certain genre combinations, like **Family, Fantasy, and Adventure**, are highly lucrative in terms of revenue.
- Other combinations, such as **Western, Action, Drama, and History**, score higher on critical acclaim.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to support the analysis:
- **Histograms** showing the distribution of movie runtimes and their correlation with revenue.
- **Bar charts** that illustrate the impact of different runtime levels on box office success.
- **Comparative bar charts** displaying the average revenue and vote average across different genre combinations.

## Conclusion
This EDA reveals significant patterns in movie characteristics that correlate with box office performance. **Longer runtimes and certain genre combinations are key factors in determining a movie's financial and critical success.**
